# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of our community is to be inclusive to everyone. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender identity and expression, nationality, level of experience, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- **Be respectful:** Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behavior.
- **Be inclusive:** Seek diverse perspectives and embrace differences. Our goal is to create an inclusive environment that welcomes all.
- **Understand differences:** We all come from different backgrounds and have different experiences. Be open to learning from others with different perspectives.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- **Harassment:** Any form of written, verbal, or physical abuse, intimidation, threats, or coercion that may threaten or endanger the well-being of any member.
- **Discrimination:** Unfair or prejudicial treatment of individuals based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
- **Inappropriate behavior:** Conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience, including but not limited to nudity, offensive language, or offensive imagery.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

- **Warning:** Violators may receive a verbal or written warning, depending on the severity of the violation.
- **Temporary Ban:** In cases of repeated or severe violations, a temporary ban from the community may be imposed.
- **Permanent Ban:** A pattern of repeated violations or a single severe violation may result in a permanent ban from the community.
